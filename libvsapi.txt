Library vs API

library
A library is a chunk of code designed for reuse that is typically installed locally.
A library is most often wrapped in an API that defines the functionality the library provides and how to use it.
A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose. you could use a library in a variety of projects. (Various specialized services in our case)
For example : Numpy is a library of Python, adding support for large, multi-dimensional
arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to
operate on these arrays.





API
An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program or library  without having direct access. ( giving specifications for our need to various vendors in our case).

There will be back-end code to support the front-end code which needs to be accessible to programmers for Custom Software Development.
Now how do a programmer access this front-end code? Yeah, the API â€“ the Interface to Library.
An API (Application Programming Interface) are the functions/methods (the front-end code) in a library that you can call to ask it to do things for you.
Uber ,Ola uses Google Maps API to show navigations and ways .
API can be used to Get , create , update and delete the data.
API return responses in the form of JSON.
JSON stands for Javascript object notation.
JSON format is representation of data in key value pair.
