The Access Token is a credential that can be used by an application to 
access an API.

It can be any type of token (such as an opaque string or a JWT) and is 
meant for an API. Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of 
this token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific 
actions (as specified by the scope that has been granted).

The Access Token should be used as a Bearer credential and transmitted 
in an HTTP Authorization header to the API.
