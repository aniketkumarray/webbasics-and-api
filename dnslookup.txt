about dns lookup
This test will list DNS records for a domain in priority order. The DNS lookup is done directly against the domain's authoritative name server, so changes to DNS Records should show up instantly. By default, the DNS lookup tool will return an IP address if you give it a name (e.g. www.example.com)
